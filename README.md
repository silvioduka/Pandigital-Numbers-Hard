Pandigital Numbers - Hard - from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka

If a number contains each of the digits from 0 to 9 at least once (0 not being the leading digit), it is considered to be pandigital. 

For example, 1076398452 is pandigital. 

Similarly, 11145689723232309899 is also pandigital. 


Tasks: 

(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is pandigital or not. 

(Hard) In addition to verifying the number being pandigital, display the number of times each digit appears in that number.
